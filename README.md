## Smart Reader
 - About - Smart Reader is a dapp that allows users to learn about smart contracts in human readable form. 
 
 - Usage -  Smart Reader is a decentralized application that allows users to easily learn about smart contracts and the web3 ecosystem. The dapp takes in a smart contract address, queries Etherscan for the contract's code, and then queries ChatGPT to convert the code into a human-readable document.

## Getting Started
Smart Reader currently supports the following networks:

-   Ethereum: A decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).
-   Polygon: A Layer 2 scaling solution that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network.
-   Goerli: A proof-of-authority (PoA) test network that allows developers to test their applications without using real Ether.

To get started with Dapp Name, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.

	`git clone https://github.com/vidvidvid/smart-reader` 

2.  Install the dependencies by running the following command:

	 `yarn install`

3.  Start the dapp by running the following command:

    `yarn start`


4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technology
Smart Reader is built using the following technologies:

-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   ChakraUI: A component library that provides a set of accessible and reusable UI components.
-   Gelato: A protocol for automating smart contract executions on Ethereum.
-   IPFS: A protocol and network for storing and sharing files in a distributed system.
-   WalletConnect: An open-source protocol for connecting decentralized applications to mobile wallets.
-   TheGraph: A decentralized indexing protocol for querying data from blockchain networks.
-   ChatGPT API: An AI language model that converts code into human-readable text.

## Usage
To use Dapp Name, follow these steps:

1.  Connect your wallet to the dapp using WalletConnect.
    
2.  Choose the network you'd like to use (Ethereum, Polygon, or Goerli).
    
3.  Perform the desired task using the available options.
